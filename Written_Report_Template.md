# Kickstarting with Excel - FRM's Tec Data Bootcamp Challenge #1

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The analysis performed had the objective of giving Louise's two useful data insights to help her determine two factors: how does a campaign performs based on its launch date and its funding goals. As her current play Fever got funded in fast fashion, she has the doubt on how the period and the goal at launching can impact the outcome of a play fundraising.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
After completing Module 1 exercises, Deliverable 1 was easy to perform, even without any hint. Disfortunately, even after help of a peer whom I considered until today an Excel god, Deliverable 2 was impossible to correctly calculate, and it was outright frustrating not being able to identify where is my mistake, which, for this ocassion, due to starting the challenge late and not being able to use the previous office hours I won't be able to solve until I get the grader's feedback.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) The May - July period stands as the months you want to lauch a campaign.
2) December definitively is a month to overlook, as it can be seen that almost the same amount of succesful and failed campaigns take place in that month.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It is biased on the extreme, as ID 122 "The Time Jumper" stands for a goal of $100,000,000.00 with a total pledged of $0. This tremendous outlier resides on the "ambition" of Louise for a live-action Sephoria sci-fi film in the US, and such kind of outliers, as seen in class and the module 1.5, can skrew the data sample and with so, the data can't be exact and reliable at 100%.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For me, it could also be handy to include a graph containing possible subcategories that could be used instead of plays according to its similarity to it, such as television, shorts, radio & podcasts and animation, to know whether people would be willing to fund this kind of subcategories over plays, in which countries would it suitable and up to which amounts it can be reasonable, if plays were ultimately not chosen.
